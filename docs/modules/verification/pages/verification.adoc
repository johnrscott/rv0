= Verification

There are two aspects to checking that the CPU implementation is correct: checking that the behaviour specification complies with the RISC-V specification; and checking that the design behaviour matches the specification.

The plan for designing and testing the CPU is as follows:

1. Design the modules as per the specification/design outline.

Next, the design will be compared against the specification:

2. Create a testing plan for functional verification, and develop a set of testbenches to implement this plan.
3. Create a formal verification plan, and implement it for the design.

Finally, the design will be compared against expected RISC-V behaviour (which will checking the specification complies with RISC-V)

4. Compare the behaviour of the design with expected behaviour using a set of RISC-V unit tests.
