= Specification

This part summarises the specification for the design, including the instructions that needs supporting, the CSR registers, and the interrupts/exceptions. Throughout the specification, the RISC-V specification is referenced in the following format:

* `v1_c9` means RISC-V volume 1 (unprivileged ISA), chapter 9
* `v1_t9.1` means RISC-V volume 1 (unprivileged ISA), table 9.1
* `v2_s2.3` means RISC-V volume 2 (privileged architecture), section 2.3

All references to volume 1 refer to version 20191213 (document `riscv-spec-20191213.pdf`), and references to volume 2 refer to version 20211203 (document `riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf`). Both documents are available from the https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/[official specification page].

Other non-ISA specifications are also used. References to the Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) Specification refer to version 1.0.0, 3/2023 (document `riscv-plic-1.0.0.pdf`, available https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/RISC-V+Technical+Specifications[here]). References use a format like:

* `plic_f1` means RISC-V PLIC specification, figure 1

== CPU State

The registers required by the RISC-V implementation are summarised in this section. The register file contains 32 registers which are each 32 bits wide, called `x0`-`x31`. The first register `x0` is writable, but always returns zero when read. The program counter is 32 bits wide, and is initialised to the reset vector.

=== Control and Status Registers

A certain minimal set of control and status registers (CSRs) are required by the RISC-V privileged specification. Each is listed in the format "`CSR-address CSR-name`: description" below.

The following informational registers are required to be present, but can be read-only zero:

* `0xf11 mvendorid`: read-only; returns 0 to indicate not implemented.
* `0xf12 marchid`: read-only; returns 0 to indicate not implemented.
* `0xf13 mimpid`: read-only; returns 0 to indicate not implemented.
* `0xf14 mhartid`: read-only; single hart system, returns 0 to indicate hart 0.
* `0xf15 mconfigptr`: read-only zero, configuration platform-specification defined
* `0x301 misa`: read/write; single legal value 0 always returned (WARL), meaning architecture is determined by non-standard means (it is rv32im_zicsr implementing M-mode only).

The status of the CPU is stored in the following status registers:

* `0x300 mstatus`: read/write, containing both WPRI and WARL fields. The bit fields which are non-zero are as follows (assumes only M-mode):
** bit 3: MIE (interrupt enable), read/write
** bit 7: MPIE (previous value of interrupt enable), read/write (?)
** bits [12:11]: MPP (previous privilege mode), WARL always 0b11 (?)
  
* `0x310 mstatush`: read/write, upper 32-bit of status; all fields are read-only zero (only little-endian memory is supported).
  
In addition to the global bit in the status register, interrupts are controlled and monitored by these registers:

* `0x304 mie`: read/write interrupt-enable register. To enable an interrupt in M-mode, both mstatus.MIE and the bit in mie must be set. Bits corresponding to interrupts that cannot occur must be read-only zero.
* `0x344 mip`: 32-bit read/write interrupt-pending register. Since all fields are read-only, writes to this CSR are no-op. The following bits are defined:
** bit 3: machine software interrupt pending (read-only)
** bit 7: machine timer interrupt pending (read-only)
** bit 11: machine-level external interrupt pending (read-only)

When a trap occurs (either due to an interrupt or a exception), the following registers determine where control flow is transferred to and where it returns to after the trap:

* `0x305 mtvec`: read-only, trap handler vector table base address
** bits [1:0]: 1 (vectored mode)
** bits [31:2]: trap vector table base address (4-byte aligned)
* `0x341 mepc`: 32-bit, read/write register, stores the return-address from trap handler. WARL, valid values are allowed physical addresses (4-byte aligned and fit within physical memory address width).

Information about the trap is obtained from these registers:

* `0x342 mcause`: 32-bit, read/write, stores exception code and bit indicating whether trap is interrupt. Exception code is WLRL.
* `0x343 mtval`: read-only zero

In addition, software may use this register in any way while processing traps:

* `0x340 mscratch`: 32-bit read/write register for use by trap handlers

The following privileged-mode registers hold performance monitoring information:

* `0xb00 mcycle`: low 32 bits of read/write 64-bit register incrementing at a constant rate
* `0xb80 mcycleh`: high 32 bits of read/write, 64-bit register containing number of clock cycles executed by the processor.
* `0xb02 minstret`: low 32 bits of read/write, 64-bit register containing number of instructions retired by the processor.
* `0xb82 minstreth`: high 64 bits of read/write, 64-bit register containing number of instructions retired by the processor.

These registers are also accessible via the following shadows (intended for use by unprivileged mode; however, there is only M-mode here, so there is no distinction between privilege levels):

* `0bc00 cycle`: read-only shadow of mcycle
* `0xc80 cycleh`: read-only shadow of mcycleh
* `0xc02 instret`: read-only shadow of minstret
* `0xc82 instreth`: read-only shadow of minstreth

The 64-bit `mtime` register is memory-mapped (it is not a CSR); however, it does have a read-only shadow as a CSR:

* `0xc01 time`: read-only shadow of lower 32 bits of memory mapped 64-bit mtime
* `0xc81 timeh`: read-only shadow of upper 32 bits of memory mapped 64-bit mtime

Finally, the following required performance monitoring counters are all implemented as read-only zero

* `(0xb00 + n) mhpmcountern`: read-only zero (`n` ranges from 3 to 32)
* `(0xb80 + n) mhpmcounternh`: read-only zero (`n` ranges from 3 to 32)
* `(0x320 + n) mhpmevent`: read-only zero (`n` ranges from 3 to 32)
* `(0xc00 + n) hpmcountern`:  read-only zero (`n` ranges from 3 to 32)
* `(0xc80 + n) hpmcounternh`: read-only zero (`n` ranges from 3 to 32)

== Traps

The standard privileged architecture requires support for exceptions and interrupts.

At the start of each instruction cycle, a trap is triggered transferring control to an interrupt vector, if both (`v2_s3.1.9`):

* Interrupts are globally enabled (`MIE` bit set in `mstatus`)
* An interrupt enable bit (`mie`) and corresponding interrupt pending bit (`mip`) are both set

While an instruction is in execution, if it raises an exception, a trap is triggered transferring control to the exception vector.

The process of triggering a trap takes one cycle, and is the same for both an exception and an interrupt:

* The `mepc` CSR is set to the current program counter (instruction interrupted or raising the exception) (`v2_s3.1.14`)
* The program counter is set to a trap vector. For exceptions, this is the `base` address in `mtvec` (`v2_s3.1.7`). For interrupts, it is `base + 4*cause`, where `cause` is from the exception code column in `v2_t3.6`. (This design uses vectored interrupts.)
* The `mcause` CSR is set to the exception code in `v2_t3.6`. The interrupt bit is set for an interrupt (`v2_s3.1.15`).
* The `MIE` bit in `mstatus` is copied to `MPIE`, and the `MIE` bit is set to 0 (`v2_s3.1.6.1`)




=== Interrupts

The basic interrupt mechanism follows the Core Local Interruptor (CLINT) specification, based on SiFive chips. The CLINT memory map begins at address `0x1000_0000`. The meaning of the memory-mapped I/O registers in this region are as follows:

* `msip`: write 1 to this bit to request a software interrupt, and write 0 to clear it. The value of this bit is reflected in the read-only `MSIP` field of the `mip` CSR. The register is initialised to zero.
* `mtimecmp`: this is the 64-bit timer compare register as described in the RISC-V privileged ISA specification. A timer interrupt becomes pending exactly when `mtime >= mtimecmp`. It is initialised to zero.
* `mtime`: this is the 64-bit real time register, which increments at a constant rate with wall clock time. It is initialised to zero.

The external interrupt bit `meip` in `mip` (the interrupt-pending register) comes directly from an external interrupt controller which follows the PLIC specification (`plic_f1`). There is only a single hart in this system, which only implements M-mode, therefore there is only one signal line from the PLIC to the hart (the M-mode external interrupt signal; see `plic_s1.3`).

=== Exceptions

When an instruction is executed, it may synchronously raise an exception (meaning the exception is associated with the instruction being executed, and raising the exception will deterministically trigger a trap on the next instruction). The following subset of exceptions defined in `v2_t3.6` is implemented in the design:

.Supported exceptions
[#exceptions, cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Exception code | Exception | Caused by

| 0 | Instruction address misaligned | Program counter not four-byte-aligned on an unconditional jump or branch taken (`v2_s2.2`). Exception is raised on the jump/branch instruction itself.
| 1 | Instruction access fault | Program counter does not fall within the instruction memory address region. Exception raised on the instruction with invalid program counter.
| 2 | Illegal instruction | The fetched instruction is not supported by this implementation (i.e. is not RV32I, Zicsr, `mret` or `wfi`).
| 3 | Breakpoint | The `ebreak` instruction was executed
| 5 | Load access fault | a load instruction was executed with an address which is not in main memory or an I/O region 
| 7 | Store access fault | a store instruction was executed with an address which is not in main memory or an I/O region, or the address is read-only
| 11 | (M-mode) Environment call | The `ecall` instruction was executed
|===

In this implementation, load/store instructions do not have alignment requirements, so the load/store address misaligned exceptions are not required.


== Memory Map

The memory map for the physical address space is as follows (all addresses are in hexadecimal):

.Memory regions
[#mem-regions, cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Memory Region   | Address range         | Size                 | Physical Memory Attributes | Notes

| Instruction ROM | 0000_0000 - 1000_0000 | 1024                 | Instruction fetch only     |
| I/O             | 1000_0000 - 2000_0000 | Sum of special register sizes   | Read/write (load/store)    | See <<special-io-regs>> below
| Main Memory     | 2000_0000 - 2000_0400 | 1024                 | Read/write (load/store)    | 
|===

The addresses in the I/O region are vacant by default (load/store accesses generate an illegal instruction exception). The accessible addresses are given below:

.Special registers in I/O memory
[#special-io-regs, cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Address    | Register name             | Register size | Attributes

| 1000_0000    | msip                      | 4           | Read/write, but only bit 0 is modified     
| 1000_4000    | mtimecmp                  | 8           | Read/write (`v2_s3.2.1`)                     
| 1000_bff8    | mtime                     | 8           | Read/write (`v2_s3.2.1`)                  
|===

Certain addresses in the instruction memory region have the following defined purposes:

.Special vectors in instruction memory
[#special-instr-vectors, cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Start Address | Memory-mapped Register    | Size

| 0000_0000    | Reset vector (initial PC) | 4                                  
| 0000_0004    | NMI vector                | 4                                  
| 0000_0008    | Exception vector (mtvec)  | 4                                  
| 0000_0014    | Software interrupt vector | 4                                  
| 0000_0024    | Timer interrupt vector    | 4                                  
| 0000_0034    | External interrupt vector | 4                                  
|===

== Instructions

The required instructions are the 32-bit RV32I base integer ISA, the Zicsr extension for CSR manipulation, and the privileged-architecture instructions `mret` and `wfi`. Each category of instructions is defined below

=== Privileged Instructions

The following instructions are required for code executing in machine mode (the only privilege level in this design) (`v2_s3.3`): `ecall`, `ebreak`, `mret`, and `wfi`.

The `ecall` and `ebreak` instructions are required by the unprivileged specification RV32I (`v1_s2.8`). Since the unprivileged instructions are also executing in M-mode in this design, these `ecall` and `ebreak` instructions do the same thing as the M-mode versions.

The instructions `ecall` and `ebreak` raise the exceptions shown in <<exceptions>>, and take no further action.

The instruction `mret` is executed by software to return from a trap. It performs the following steps:

* Copies the `MPIE` bit to `MIE` in `mstatus`
* Sets the `MPIE` to 1
* Sets the program counter to `mepc` (`v2_s3.3.2`)

The `wfi` is implemented as a NOP (`v2_s3.3.3`)

=== Upper Immediate (RV32I)

=== Register-Register (RV32I)

=== Register-Immediate (RV32I)

=== Unconditional Jump (RV32I)

=== Conditional Branch (RV32I)

=== Load (RV32I)

=== Store (RV32I)

=== Control and Status Register (Zicsr)

The unprivileged specification (`v1_ch9`) defines the behaviour of the instructions which manipulate CSRs, in the Zicsr ISA extension. The behaviour of the instructions is as follows:

* `csrrw`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`, and then write the source register `rs1` to the addressed CSR.
* `csrrwi`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`, and then zero extend the immediate `uimm` and write it to the addressed CSR.
* `csrrs`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`. Then, only if the source register `rs1` is not `x0`, bitwise-OR the current value of the CSR with `rs1`, and write the result back to the CSR (i.e. set bits in the CSR where there is a 1 in `rs1`).
* `csrrsi`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`. Then, only if the immediate `uimm` is not `0`, bitwise-OR the current value of the CSR with `uimm` (zero-extended to 32 bits), and write the result back to the CSR (i.e. set bits in the CSR where there is a 1 in `uimm`).
* `csrrc`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`. Then, only if the source register `rs1` is not `x0`, bitwise-AND the current value of the CSR with !`rs1`, and write the result back to the CSR (i.e. clear bits in the CSR where there is a 1 in `rs1`).
* `csrrci`: read the addressed CSR into destination register `rd`. Then, only if the immediate `uimm` is not `0`, bitwise-AND the current value of the CSR with `!uimm` (zero-extended to 32 bits _after_ negation), and write the result back to the CSR (i.e. clear bits in the CSR where there is a 1 in `uimm`).

Any instructions that write to a CSR:

* will raise an illegal instruction exception if the CSR is read-only. In this case, the state of registers will be as if the instruction did not occur.
* will not change the value of an CSR bits that are read-only in otherwise writable registers
* for WLRL fields in writable CSRs, any value that is written (even an invalid one) will be written anyway, without any checking in hardware.
* for WARL fields in writable CSRs, any attempt to write an invalid value will cause no change in the CSR field (the old value will be retained).
* the write will displace any other automatic modification of the CSR by hardware; for example, writing to `instret` will stop auto-increment of `instret` on that instruction (`v1_s9.1`). This is also interpreted as applying to all counters, including `mcycle`, etc.)

Instructions that read CSRs read the value of the CSR as it was just prior to instruction execution (e.g. the value of `instret` is taken before incrementing in due to the read instruction itself).

Instructions that attempt to perform an operation on a non-existent CSR raise an illegal instruction exception.

==== Notes on behaviour

* The instructions are defined (`v1_s9.1`) to atomically read and write CSRs. Since there is only one hart in this design, this required is satisfied by a single read/write operation.
* The `csrrw` and `csrrwi` instructions are defined (`v1_t9.1`) to omit the CSR read if the destination register `rd` is `x0`, and not trigger any side effects that would occur on a read. In this design, no CSR has a side effect that occurs on a read, so for simplicity the `*rw*` instructions can perform a read irrespective of `rd`, and attempt the write to `rd` (which will have no effect if `rd` is `x0`).
* In this design, all CSRs are 32-bits wide, so there is no need to zero-extend them before writing to registers.
* In this design, writing invalid values to WLRL fields does not raise an illegal instruction exception (`v2_s2.3`).
