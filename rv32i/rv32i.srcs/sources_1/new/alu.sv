/// Arithmetic Control Unit
///
/// This is a purely combinational ALU implementation.
///
/// The operation depends on the 4-bit alu_op as
/// follows: 
///
/// 0_000: r = a + b
/// 1_000: r = a - b
/// 0_001: r = a << b
/// x_010: r = a < b ? 1 : 0
/// x_011: r = signed(a) < signed(b) ? 1 : 0
/// x_100: r = a ^ b
/// 0_101: r = a >> b
/// 1_101: r = signed(a) >>> signed(b)
/// x_110: r = a | b
/// x_111: r = a & b
///
/// The separation in alu_op indicates that the top bit
/// comes form bit 30 of the instruction, and the bottom
/// 3 bits come from funct3, in R-type register-register
/// instructions.
///
/// For I-type register-immediate instructions, ensure
/// that the top bit is 0 for addi, slti, sltiu, xori
/// ori, and andi. For slli, srli, and srai, set the top
/// bit to bit 30 of the instruction, and set b to the
/// shift amount (shamt) field. Set the low three
/// bits to funct3 in all cases.
